# Hi, I'm Kavin👋

I'm a Computer Science graduate from the University of Birmingham, currently based in Malaysia 🇲🇾.
I focus on building data-driven and system-oriented projects that reflect real-world use cases and professional engineering standards.

This GitHub serves as a professional portfolio for work developed beyond academic coursework. 
It documents my learning, showcases practical skills, and highlights structured, well-documented projects.
Just a little disclaimer, these projects are of my own personal undertaking and I will not be enlisting the help of any AI or copying any established projects.

## 🧭 Why This Git

- Build and showcase professional, real-world projects
- Practice clean code, structure, and documentation
- Maintain a public record of technical growth
- Support applications for data, systems, and technical roles
- Establish a professional public presence that gives employers confidence in my technical approach and consistency
